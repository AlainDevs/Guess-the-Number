Guess the Number

**v1**

In version 1, I asked copilot to create a uiviewcontroller for me, specipfic the button logic. it did a great job. However, I need to check is the guess number too high or too low than the secret number.

**v2**

So, version 2 has made by copilot again, it avoid duplicating the check for score > 0 by using a separate variable to store the message that will be displayed to the user. 

**v3**

copilot help me to initialize the message variable with a default value to avoid duplicating message.
